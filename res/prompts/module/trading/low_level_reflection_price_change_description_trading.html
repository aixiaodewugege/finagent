        <br>1. Short-Term: Over the past $$short_term_past_date_range$$ days, the price movement ratio has shown $$short_term_past_price_movement$$.
        <br>2. Medium-Term: Over the past $$medium_term_past_date_range$$ days, the price movement ratio has shown $$medium_term_past_price_movement$$.
