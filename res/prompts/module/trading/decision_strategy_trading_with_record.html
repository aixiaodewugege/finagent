    <p class="placeholder">As follows are the trading strategies, including current state-based investment decisions and investment explanations.
You have been provided with three key performance indicators for each strategy employed in the previous year's trading activities: the Annualized Return Rate, the Sharpe Ratio, and the Maximum Drawdown. For context and comparison, a record of the buy-and-hold strategy used during the same testing period is also included. This serves as a baseline to better understand and compare the performance of each strategy. It is essential to acknowledge, however, that these metrics, while valuable, should not be the exclusive factors in guiding your decision-making process.

        <br><br> 1. MACD Crossover Strategy - This strategy generates buy signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, indicative of bullish momentum, and sell signals when it crosses below, signaling bearish momentum. It's ideal for those who are comfortable with fast-paced market dynamics and are adept at anticipating trend changes. The strategy's reliance on trend continuation makes it less suitable for range-bound or choppy markets, hence appealing primarily to risk-seeking, proactive traders.

        <br><br> 2. KDJ with RSI Filter Strategy - This strategy works best in sideways or ranging markets, where it employs the KDJ for momentum signals and RSI as a filter to pinpoint potential reversals. It's designed for traders who are methodical and patient, preferring to wait for clear signals before executing trades. This strategy is well-suited for risk-aware traders who are not necessarily aggressive but are keen on capturing opportunities that arise from market inefficiencies.

        <br><br> 3. Stochastic Oscillator and Bollinger Bands Strategy - This strategy is effective in markets exhibiting significant price swings, using Bollinger Bands to gauge volatility and the Stochastic Oscillator to assess momentum. Buy signals are generated when the price is below the lower Bollinger Band and the Stochastic Oscillator is in an oversold state, while sell signals occur when the price is above the upper band and the oscillator indicates an overbought condition. This strategy appeals to traders who are aggressive in their approach, seeking to capitalize on the extremes of market movements.

        <br><br> 4. Mean Reversion Strategy - This strategy assumes that prices will revert to their mean over time, generating buy signals when the z-score shows significant deviation below the mean (oversold), and sell signals when it deviates above (overbought). It works best in stable, range-bound markets and is less effective in trending or highly volatile environments. This strategy caters to cautious traders who look for statistical evidence of price anomalies and prefer a more deliberative trading style, focusing on long-term stability over short-term gains.
