    <p class="placeholder">As the above Kline chart shows, today's date is $$date$$. The chart's date range is from past $$long_term_past_date_range$$ days to next $$long_term_next_date_range$$ days. Additionally, the price movements within this range can be categorized into three time horizons:
        <br>1. Short-Term: Over the past $$short_term_past_date_range$$ days, the price movement ratio has shown $$short_term_past_price_movement$$, and for the next $$short_term_next_date_range$$ days, it indicates $$short_term_next_price_movement$$.
        <br>2. Medium-Term: Over the past $$medium_term_past_date_range$$ days, the price movement ratio has shown $$medium_term_past_price_movement$$, and for the next $$medium_term_next_date_range$$ days, it indicates $$medium_term_next_price_movement$$.
        <br>3. Long-Term: Over the past $$long_term_past_date_range$$ days, the price movement ratio has shown $$long_term_past_price_movement$$, and for the next $$long_term_next_date_range$$ days, it indicates $$long_term_next_price_movement$$.
        <br>* For each price movement, you should not only focus on the starting price and ending price but also pay attention to the price change trends.
