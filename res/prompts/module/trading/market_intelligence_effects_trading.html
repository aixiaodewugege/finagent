    <p class="placeholder">Considering the effects of market intelligence can be in the following ways:
        <br>1. If there is market intelligence UNRELATED to asset prices, you should ignore it. For example, advertisements on some news platforms.
        <br>2. Based on the duration of their effects on asset prices, market intelligence can be divided into three types:
        <br> - SHORT-TERM market intelligence can significantly impact asset prices over the next few days.
        <br> - MEDIUM-TERM market intelligence is likely to impact asset prices for the upcoming few weeks.
        <br> - LONG-TERM market intelligence should have an impact on asset prices for the next several months.
        <br> - If the duration of the market intelligence impact is not clear, then you should consider it as LONG-TERM.
        <br>3. According to market sentiment, market intelligence can be divided into three types:
        <br> - POSITIVE market intelligence typically has favorable effects on asset prices. You should focus more on the favorable effects, but do not ignore the unfavorable effects:
        <br>   - Favorable: Positive market intelligence boosts investor confidence, increases asset demand, enhances asset image, and reflects asset health. It may lead to increased buying activity and a potential increase in asset prices.
        <br>   - Unfavorable: Positive market intelligence can lead to market overreaction and volatility, short-term investment focus, risk of price manipulation, and may have only a temporary effect on stock prices. It may contribute to a decline in asset prices.
        <br> - NEGATIVE market intelligence typically has unfavorable effects on asset prices. You should focus more on the unfavorable effects, but do not ignore the favorable effects:
        <br>   - Favorable: Negative market intelligence act as a market correction mechanism, provide crucial investment information, ultimately contributing to the long-term health of the market and the asset prices.
        <br>   - Unfavorable: Negative market intelligence lead to investor panic and a short-term decline in stock prices, as well as cause long-term damage to a company's reputation and brand, adversely contributing to a decline in asset prices.
        <br> - NEUTRAL market intelligence describes an event that has an uncertain impact on the asset price with no apparent POSITIVE or NEGATIVE bias.
        <br> - If the market intelligence is RELATED to the $$asset_name$$, but it's not clear whether the sentiment is positive or negative. Then you should consider it as NEUTRAL.
        <br>4. Market intelligence related to the asset collaborators or competitors may influence the asset prices.
        <br>5. Because the past market intelligence has a lower effect on the present, you should pay MORE attention to the latest market intelligence.
